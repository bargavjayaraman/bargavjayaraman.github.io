&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, we discussed a motivational scenario about why we need to check for privacy vulnerability of differentially private machine learning models. In this post, we will quantify this privacy vulnerability in terms of leakage of membership information through experimental evaluation on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CIFAR-100&lt;/a&gt; data set. This work has been accepted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;USENIX Security&amp;rsquo;19&lt;/a&gt; and the full manuscript can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pubs/usenix2019/evaluatingdp.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-introduction-of-evaluation-procedure&#34;&gt;Brief introduction of evaluation procedure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We train logistic regression and two-layer neural network models with differential privacy over 10,000 training instances, and separate 10,000 instances are used for testing.  Comparison of model utility and privacy leakage is made for various differential privacy approaches that differ in the composition of privacy budget. These are namely, na&amp;#x00EF;ve composition (NC), advanced composition (AC), zero concentrated differential privacy (zCDP) and R&amp;#x00E8;nyi differential privacy (RDP). RDP and zCDP have stricter composition property which allows them to add much less noise in comparison to NC for a given privacy budget. Thus, they achieve better model utility but at the cost of privacy leakage, which we show in our experimental results. We calculate the model utility as accuracy loss relative to a non-private baseline model. For privacy leakage, we evaluate the advantage of membership inference attacker, which is given as the difference between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of detecting whether a given instance is a part of the training set. We implement the membership inference attacks of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7958568&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shokri et al.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8429311&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Yeom et al&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For brevity, we stick to the results of Yeom et al. membership inference attack on neural network s trained with NC and RDP in this post. Interested readers are referred to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pubs/usenix2019/evaluatingdp.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;full paper&lt;/a&gt; for a discussion on other experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why you should evaluate your private model</title>

&lt;p&gt;Privacy concerns arise when training machine learning models over sensitive data such as personal information about individuals. These concerns become more serious when the trained models are publicly deployed as a service. While differential privacy can alleviate these privacy concerns, it is highly sensitive to the implementation choices such as the privacy budget and the type of differential privacy relaxation used. In our paper (to appear in USENIX Security’19), we experimentally evaluate the impact of these implementation choices on the privacy leakage. More concretely, we quantify how much information is leaked to the adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following fictional scenario illustrates the privacy concerns and the risks involved in publicly deploying models without properly analysing the differential privacy implementation choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-quickservice-bank-scenario&#34;&gt;The QuickService Bank Scenario&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go to a bank for a personal loan, the approval process often takes &lt;a href=&#34;https://studentloanhero.com/featured/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-approved-for-a-personal-loan/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;from a day or two to a couple of weeks&lt;/a&gt;. However the QuickService Bank, living up to its name, launched an online service where you could enter your personal details and get an instant loan approval. The workhorse behind this quick service is their state-of-the-art machine learning model trained on the bank’s existing customer data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;img/quickservicebank_scenario.png&#34; &gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-went-wrong&#34;&gt;What went wrong?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online loan approval service earned great popularity and brought in more business for QuickService Bank. But the bank’s joy didn’t last for long. Mandark, a notorious black-hat hacker, prowled on the online service and started leaking the identity of the bank’s customers. This type of attack is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7958568&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;membership inference&lt;/a&gt; where the attacker identifies the presence or absence of a record in the training data.






&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;img/mandark_attack.png&#34; &gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;differential-privacy-to-the-rescue&#34;&gt;Differential privacy to the rescue!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dismayed by the attack, QuickService Bank temporarily disabled the online service and hired Dexter who is a security expert. Dexter learns about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/differential-privacy/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fpubs%2F64346%2Fdwork.pdf&#34;&gt;differential privacy&lt;/a&gt; and decides to deploy it for privately training the bank’s loan approval model while still prioritizing the model’s accuracy. But due to the model’s complexity, the required privacy budget turned out to be 1000.






&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;img/dexter_dp.png&#34; &gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;





&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;img/dexter_rdp.png&#34; &gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

Dexter, knowing that such a high budget might not be desirable for strong privacy, uses relaxed definitions (&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01887&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07476&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) to reduce the budget to 10 without compromising on the model accuracy. Happy with his privacy implementation, Dexter asked QuickService Bank to make the service online again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;again-what-went-wrong&#34;&gt;Again… what went wrong?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the differential privacy safeguard reduced Mandark’s attack success rate, he was still able to reveal the membership information of a few bank customers. Why did this happen? While the relaxed definitions allows the reduction in privacy budget, the amount of noise added in the model training remains the same. Thus, the effective privacy is the same as provided by differential privacy with high privacy budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we will further explore this observation through empirical evaluation on real world data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analysis of Private ML Models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models are being extensively trained on sensitive human data (such as pictures, videos and patient health records) and are being publicly deployed as a service. With such systems in  place, privacy of the individuals involved in the model training becomes a real concern. While differential privacy provides a solution to this problem, there is always a privacy-utility trade-off when training models privately, which is not well understood. Often the practical deployments choose the model utility over privacy, that may lead to indiscernable privacy vulnerabilities. One such example of privacy vulnerability is whether an adversary can identify a particular individual in the training data. Also, what type of individuals are more vulnerable to such attacks? This question is also directly related to the problem of fairness. In light of such vulnerabilities, what privacy parameters should the ML deployments use to mitigate the risks? Our project tries to shed light on these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Privacy Preserving Machine Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-party computation protocols provide computational security to both data and model through encrypted computations. Differential privacy, on the other hand, provides information theoretic privacy by perturbing the computations with noise. These techniques consider a different threat model and have orthogonal goals. In this project, we combine both technuqies to achieve strong security and privacy for machine learning on sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
