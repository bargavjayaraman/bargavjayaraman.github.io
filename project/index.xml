      <title>Analysis of Private ML Models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models are being extensively trained on sensitive human data (such as pictures, videos and patient health records) and are being publicly deployed as a service. With such systems in  place, privacy of the individuals involved in the model training becomes a real concern. While differential privacy provides a solution to this problem, there is always a privacy-utility trade-off when training models privately, which is not well understood. Often the practical deployments choose the model utility over privacy, that may lead to indiscernable privacy vulnerabilities. One such example of privacy vulnerability is whether an adversary can identify a particular individual in the training data. Also, what type of individuals are more vulnerable to such attacks? This question is also directly related to the problem of fairness. In light of such vulnerabilities, what privacy parameters should the ML deployments use to mitigate the risks? Our project tries to shed light on these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decentralized Certificate Authorities</title>
      <link>https://bargavjayaraman.github.io/project/dca/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Certificate authorities have a single point of failure in signing the digital certificates &amp;ndash; what if their signing key gets stolen? This is possible if the signing key is stored on a single machine. Instead, we propose secret sharing of signing keys across multiple machines such that the certificate authorites can combine the secret shares within the multi-party computation protocol and sign the digital certificate in an encrypted way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Privacy Preserving Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://bargavjayaraman.github.io/project/ppml/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-party computation protocols provide computational security to both data and model through encrypted computations. Differential privacy, on the other hand, provides information theoretic privacy by perturbing the computations with noise. These techniques consider a different threat model and have orthogonal goals. In this project, we combine both technuqies to achieve strong security and privacy for machine learning on sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
