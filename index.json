In this post, we will quantify this privacy vulnerability in terms of leakage of membership information through experimental evaluation on CIFAR-100 data set. This work has been accepted at USENIX Security\u0026rsquo;19 and the full manuscript can be found here.\nBrief introduction of evaluation procedure We train logistic regression and two-layer neural network models with differential privacy over 10,000 training instances, and separate 10,000 instances are used for testing. Comparison of model utility and privacy leakage is made for various differential privacy approaches that differ in the composition of privacy budget. These are namely, na\u0026#x00EF;ve composition (NC), advanced composition (AC), zero concentrated differential privacy (zCDP) and R\u0026#x00E8;nyi differential privacy (RDP). RDP and zCDP have stricter composition property which allows them to add much less noise in comparison to NC for a given privacy budget. Thus, they achieve better model utility but at the cost of privacy leakage, which we show in our experimental results. We calculate the model utility as accuracy loss relative to a non-private baseline model. For privacy leakage, we evaluate the advantage of membership inference attacker, which is given as the difference between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of detecting whether a given instance is a part of the training set. We implement the membership inference attacks of Shokri et al. and Yeom et al for this purpose.\nFor brevity, we stick to the results of Yeom et al. membership inference attack on neural network s trained with NC and RDP in this post. Interested readers are referred to the full paper for a discussion on other experimental results.\nExperimental observations  utility-privacy plot of NC and RDP\n how many members being revealed\n leakage is amplified across intersection of multiple runs\n  What\u0026rsquo;s more in the paper  results on Purchase-100 data set\n logistic regression results\n membership inference attack of shokri et al.\n attribute inference attack of yeom et al.\n  Conclusion ","date":1562544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563062400,"objectID":"d4f65315eedde1125cbb93ee246943cd","permalink":"https://bargavjayaraman.github.io/post/evaluating-dpml-results/","publishdate":"2019-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/evaluating-dpml-results/","section":"post","summary":"What seems safe, might not be safe in practice.","tags":["Machine Learning","Differential Privacy"],"title":"Evaluating differentially private machine learning in practice","type":"post"},{"authors":["Bargav Jayaraman"],"categories":[],"content":" Privacy concerns arise when training machine learning models over sensitive data such as personal information about individuals. These concerns become more serious when the trained models are publicly deployed as a service. While differential privacy can alleviate these privacy concerns, it is highly sensitive to the implementation choices such as the privacy budget and the type of differential privacy relaxation used. In our paper (to appear in USENIX Security’19), we experimentally evaluate the impact of these implementation choices on the privacy leakage. More concretely, we quantify how much information is leaked to the adversary.\nThe following fictional scenario illustrates the privacy concerns and the risks involved in publicly deploying models without properly analysing the differential privacy implementation choices.\nThe QuickService Bank Scenario When you go to a bank for a personal loan, the approval process often takes from a day or two to a couple of weeks. However the QuickService Bank, living up to its name, launched an online service where you could enter your personal details and get an instant loan approval. The workhorse behind this quick service is their state-of-the-art machine learning model trained on the bank’s existing customer data.\n  What went wrong? The online loan approval service earned great popularity and brought in more business for QuickService Bank. But the bank’s joy didn’t last for long. Mandark, a notorious black-hat hacker, prowled on the online service and started leaking the identity of the bank’s customers. This type of attack is called membership inference where the attacker identifies the presence or absence of a record in the training data.   Differential privacy to the rescue! Dismayed by the attack, QuickService Bank temporarily disabled the online service and hired Dexter who is a security expert. Dexter learns about differential privacy and decides to deploy it for privately training the bank’s loan approval model while still prioritizing the model’s accuracy. But due to the model’s complexity, the required privacy budget turned out to be 1000.      Dexter, knowing that such a high budget might not be desirable for strong privacy, uses relaxed definitions (here, here and here) to reduce the budget to 10 without compromising on the model accuracy. Happy with his privacy implementation, Dexter asked QuickService Bank to make the service online again.\nAgain… what went wrong? Though the differential privacy safeguard reduced Mandark’s attack success rate, he was still able to reveal the membership information of a few bank customers. Why did this happen? While the relaxed definitions allows the reduction in privacy budget, the amount of noise added in the model training remains the same. Thus, the effective privacy is the same as provided by differential privacy with high privacy budget.\nIn the next post, we will further explore this observation through empirical evaluation on real world data sets.\n","date":1562544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563062400,"objectID":"9fc0e8ab070caea6f2bfbbd00837f211","permalink":"https://bargavjayaraman.github.io/post/evaluating-dpml-intro/","publishdate":"2019-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/evaluating-dpml-intro/","section":"post","summary":"Always perform sanity check on your privacy parameters.","tags":["Machine Learning","Differential Privacy"],"title":"Why you should evaluate your private model","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

With such systems in place, privacy of the individuals involved in the model training becomes a real concern. While differential privacy provides a solution to this problem, there is always a privacy-utility trade-off when training models privately, which is not well understood. Often the practical deployments choose the model utility over privacy, that may lead to indiscernable privacy vulnerabilities. One such example of privacy vulnerability is whether an adversary can identify a particular individual in the training data. Also, what type of individuals are more vulnerable to such attacks? This question is also directly related to the problem of fairness. In light of such vulnerabilities, what privacy parameters should the ML deployments use to mitigate the risks?
