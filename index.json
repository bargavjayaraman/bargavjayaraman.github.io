However, these works assume the knowledge of the training distribution and we show that in such cases these attacks do no better than a data imputataion attack that does not have access to the model. We explore the attribute inference risks in the cases where the adversary has limited or no prior knowledge of the training distribution and show that our white-box attribute inference attack (that uses neuron activations to infer the unknown sensitive attribute) surpasses imputation in these data constrained cases. This attack uses the training distribution information leaked by the model, and thus poses privacy risk when the distribution is private.\nPrior Attribute Inference Attacks Do Not Pose Privacy Risk Prior works in attribute inference have mainly considered black-box access to the machine learning model and show successful attribute inference (in terms of attack accuracy) in the case where the adversary has access to the underlying training distribution. Our experiments show that in such cases even an imputation adversary, without access to the model, can achieve high inference accuracy, as shown in the table below:\n    \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Census (Race) \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Texas-100X (Ethnicity) \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;     Predict Most Common  0.78  0.72    Imputation Attack  0.82  0.72    Yeom et al.

Attack  0.06  0.60    WCAI (Our version of Yeom)  0.83  0.74     Comparing attribute inference accuracy of attacks\nThus, these attribute inference attacks seem to not pose any significant privacy risk as the adversary can have similar attack success without access to the model.\nSensitive Value Inference Attribute inference risk is inherently asymmetric\u0026mdash; identifying a record with minority attribute value (such as Hispanic ethnicity) does not have the same risk as identifying a record with majority attribute value (such as Non-Hispanic ethnicity). Accuracy metric does not capture this. Moreover, attribute inference definition considered by prior works also fails to distinguish these cases. We propose studying a fine-grained version of attribute inference, called sensitive value inference, that considers the attack success in inferring a particular sensitive attribute outcome.\n \nWe measure the attack success by evaluating the positive predictive value (PPV) of the inference attack in predicting the top-k candidate records with the sensitive outcome. The PPV values are between 0 and 1, where a higher value denotes a greater attack precision.\nThe Neuron Output Attack Our novel neuron output based white-box attack finds the neurons that are most correlated with the sensitive value. For this attack, the adversary selects records from a hold-out set, sets the unknown target attribute to the sensitive value, and queries the model. The adversary then identifies the set of neurons that have higher activations on average for the records with the sensitive value as the ground-truth. The adversary then uses the aggregate output of these neurons to identify the candidate records with sensitive value.\n \nModel Leaks Distribution Information In our experiments, we vary the distribution available to the adversary and also the amount of data from the respective distribution the adversary has to train the inference attack. When the adversary has access to \u0026gt;5000 records from the training distribition (not the same as the training set records), imputataion outperforms all the attribute inference attacks (incuding our white-box neuron output attack). As we decrease the known set size to 500 and 50, the imputation PPV decreases drastically whereas our neuron output attack continues to achieve high PPV. Thus the attack is able to take advantage of the training distribution information leaked by the model. The figure below depicts the case where the adversary has 500 records from the training distribution, and as shown, the neuron output attack surpasses the imputataion.\n Neurons correlated to Hispanic ethnicity for a neural network model trained on Texas-100X data set.  \nWe observe similar trend across different distribution settings and across different data sets. Detailed results can be found in the paper.\nDifferential Privacy Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Mitigate the Risk Prior works have claimed that attribute inference attacks cannot work in the cases where membership inference attacks do not succeed. Hence, the prior works\u0026rsquo; claim is that differential privacy mechanisms, that defend against membership inference attacks, also defend against attribute inference attacks. This is based on the attribute advantage metric of Yeom et al. that shows that the difference between the accuracy of inference attack across training and non-training set is bounded by differential privacy. We agree that this is true, as we shown in our experiment results in Table 2 below where the PPV of the neuron output attack is similar across both train and test sets. However, our attribute advantage metric measures the gap between the attack PPV when the adversary has access to the model (i.e., neuron output attack) versus when the adversary does not have model access (i.e., imputataion). As shown in the table below, this is not bounded by differential privacy as the neuron output attack PPV remains more or less the same with or without differential privacy.\n    \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Without DP With DP \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Train Set Test Set \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;     Imputation Attack  0.62 $\\pm$ 0.05 0.62 $\\pm$ 0.05  0.62 $\\pm$ 0.05 0.63 $\\pm$ 0.02    Neuron Output Attack  0.49 $\\pm$ 0.02 0.49 $\\pm$ 0.03  0.49 $\\pm$ 0.03 0.48 $\\pm$ 0.02     Impact of Differential Privacy (DP) on the PPV of attacks (see table in paper for error margins). Results show the PPV of attacks in predicting top-100 candidate records.\nSince the risk is due to the model leaking distribution information, it is not mitigated by differential privacy noise.\nConclusion We show that the attribute inference attacks take advantage of the model leaking sensitive information about the underlying training distribution as opposed to leaking information about individual training records. While this is often considered by researchers to be not a privacy risk since the distribution statistics are supposed to be public knowledge, we argue that when the distribution itself is a private information then any such disclosure poses a severe privacy risk. Existing defenses, such as training the model with differential privacy mechanisms, does not mitigate this distribution privacy risk.\nFull paper: Bargav Jayaraman and David Evans.

White-box attack outperforms even the imputation attack that has access to the class label. Thus, the model is leaking something beyond what an imputation can learn from the same data that the model is trained on. Is this because the imputation model is not learning effectively?  [Jul 14, 2022] Vanilla Model Training [Contd.] Here we study the inference of Asian race from Texas-100X data set to see if the trend is same as what we observed for ethnicity attribute above. For this experiment, we remove the ethnicity attribute from the model training, since it is correlated to the target race attribute as we saw above.\nPredicting Asian race from Texas-100X (I) The model is trained on general distribution and the adversary might have access to either the training set, or training distribution or a different distribution based on the adversarial knowledge.

Thus model is learning something useful about the distribution beyond the imputation. In the low setting, where the adversary only has access to skewed distribution, white-box attack still learns something useful, but combining with imputation does not further improve the PPV, suggesting that the attack signal is not different from imputation.\nPredicting Asian race from Texas-100X (II) Here the model is trained on the skewed distribution that has 15% of records with Asian race.\n   \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; High (Train) High (Test) Med (Train) Med (Test) Low (Train) Low (Test)     Random 15 $\\pm$ 0 15 $\\pm$ 0 15 $\\pm$ 0 15 $\\pm$ 0 15 $\\pm$ 0 15 $\\pm$ 0   IP 29 $\\pm$ 4 26 $\\pm$ 5 25 $\\pm$ 4 25 $\\pm$ 3 18 $\\pm$ 5 16 $\\pm$ 4   IP$^\\dagger$ 29 $\\pm$ 3 31 $\\pm$ 3 30 $\\pm$ 4 28 $\\pm$ 5 19 $\\pm$ 4 14 $\\pm$ 1   WB 40 $\\pm$ 7 34 $\\pm$ 7 40 $\\pm$ 6 35 $\\pm$ 6 34 $\\pm$ 3 36 $\\pm$ 3   WB$\\cdot$IP 46 $\\pm$ 5 46 $\\pm$ 4 47 $\\pm$ 5 48 $\\pm$ 4 18 $\\pm$ 3 18 $\\pm$ 3   WB$\\diamondsuit$IP 50 $\\pm$ 3 55 $\\pm$ 10 54 $\\pm$ 4 55 $\\pm$ 10 17 $\\pm$ 6 16 $\\pm$ 4   WB$\\square$IP 53 $\\pm$ 4 54 $\\pm$ 6 54 $\\pm$ 2 54 $\\pm$ 3 20 $\\pm$ 2 17 $\\pm$ 1   WB$\\cdot$IP$^\\dagger$ 44 $\\pm$ 2 49 $\\pm$ 3 46 $\\pm$ 6 42 $\\pm$ 6 21 $\\pm$ 3 20 $\\pm$ 4   WB$\\diamondsuit$IP$^\\dagger$ 53 $\\pm$ 5 55 $\\pm$ 7 57 $\\pm$ 4 58 $\\pm$ 8 16 $\\pm$ 7 19 $\\pm$ 8   WB$\\square$IP$^\\dagger$ 53 $\\pm$ 6 58 $\\pm$ 5 54 $\\pm$ 4 58 $\\pm$ 8 19 $\\pm$ 6 18 $\\pm$ 3    Table 8: PPV (%) for predicting top-100 records on Texas-100X.

One set of methods by which consumers can learn this sensitive information, known broadly as membership inference attacks, predicts whether or not a query record belongs to the training set. A basic membership inference attack involves an attacker with a given record and black-box access to a model who tries to determine whether said record was a member of the model\u0026rsquo;s training set.\nUnlike much of the existing research on the membership inference, though, these particular results focus on what are considered \u0026ldquo;realistic assumptions,\u0026rdquo; including conditions with skewed priors (wherein members only make up a small fraction of the candidate pool) and conditions with adversaries that select accuracy-improving inference thresholds based on specific attack goals. These new assumptions help to answer the question of how differential privacy can be implemented to provide meaningful privacy guarantees in practice.\n\nThreshold Selection In order to classify a record as either a member or a non-member, there must be a threshold that converts a real number output from a test into a Boolean. We develop a procedure to select a threshold, \u0026phi;, that allows the adversary to achieve as much privacy leakage as possible while staying beneath a maximum false positive rate, \u0026alpha;.\nThis selection procedure can be applied to any membership inference attack, including Yeom\u0026rsquo;s attack. The original version of this attack classifies a record as a member if its per-instance-loss is less than the expected training loss, whereas this new approach selects members based on a threshold \u0026phi;, which can be set to target a particular false positive rate.\n \nThe Merlin Attack In addition to this new selection procedure, we introduce a new attack known as Merlin, which stands for MEasuring Relative Loss In Neighborhood. Instead of per-instance-loss, this attack uses the direction of change of per-instance-loss when the record is slightly perturbed with noise. Merlin operates based on the intuition that, as a result of overfitting, member records are more likely to be near local minima than non-member records. This suggests that for members, loss is more likely to increase at perturbed points near the original, whereas it is equally likely to increase or decrease for non-members. For each record, a small amount of random Gaussian noise is added and the change of loss direction is recorded. This process is repeated multiple times and Merlin infers membership based on the fraction of times the loss increases.\n \nThe Morgan Attack Since Yeom and Merlin use different information to make their membership inferences, they do not always identify the same records as members; some members are more vulnerable to one attack than the other. Visualizing a combination of the attacks\u0026rsquo; results suggests that by eliminating the results with a very low per-instance-loss, a combination of the two may produce an improved PPV. The intuition here is that extremely low per-instance-losses may result in Merlin\u0026rsquo;s identification of a local minimum where there is in fact a near global minimum (which is much less strongly correlated with membership).\nThe Morgan (Measuring lOss, Relatively Greater Around Neighborhood) attack uses three different thresholds: a lower threshold on per-instance loss (\u0026phi;L), an upper threshold on per-instance loss (\u0026phi;U), and a threshold on the ratio as used by Merlin (\u0026phi;M). If a record has a per-instance-loss that falls between \u0026phi;L and \u0026phi;U, and has a Merlin ratio of at least \u0026phi;M, Morgan identifies it as a member.\n The figure shows the per-instance loss and Merlin ratio for Purchase-100X (and expanded version of the Purchase-100 dataset that we created for our experiments). Members and nonmembers are denoted by orange and purple points respectively. The boxes show the thresholds found by the threshold selection process (without access to the training data, but with the same data distribution), and illustrate the regions where members are identified by Morgan with very high confidence (PPV \u0026sim;1). (See paper for details, and more result.) \n\nImbalanced Priors Previous work on membership inference attacks assumes a candidate pool where half of the candidates are members. For most settings, especially ones where there is a serious privacy risk for an individual of being identified as a dataset member, this assumption is unrealistic. It is important to understand how well inference attacks work when the adversary\u0026rsquo;s candidate pool has a different prior probability of being amember.\n \nHere, the candidate pool from which the attacker attempts to select members has \u0026gamma; times more non-member records than member records. As shown above, even in situations that other papers do not consider, wherein there are many times more non-members than members, attacks are able to attain a high rate of positively-identified members.\nConclusion The Merlin and Morgan attacks can reliably identify members even in situations with imbalanced priors where other attacks fail to show meaningful inference risk.\nThere remains a large gap between what can be guaranteed using differential privacy methods, and what can be inferred using known inference attacks. This means better inference attacks may exist, and our results show that there are concrete ways to improve attacks (e.g., our threshold-selection procedure) and to incorporate more information to improve attacks. We are especially interested in attacks that produce extremely high PPVs, even if this is only for a small fraction of candidates, since for most scenarios this is where the most serious privacy risks lie.\nFull paper: Bargav Jayaraman, Lingxiao Wang, Katherine Knipmeyer, Quanquan Gu, David Evans.

And my case is no different, within one year of purchasing the console, I already ran out of hard disk space. So I did what any gamer would do in my situation; I ordered a 4TB external hard drive [Yay!]. Now that I planned to transfer some games from my internal HDD to the external HDD, curiosity plagued the researcher in me! Is the internal HDD faster at loading games than the external HDD? Or is it the other way around? Both schools of thoughts have their own reasoning. On one hand internal HDD is, well, internal. It uses SATA 3 connection supporting upto 600 MB/s of bandwidth. On the other hand, external HDD uses USB 3.0 connection supporting upto 625 MB/s of bandwidth. Both the hard drives have rotation speed of 5400 RPM, so it is still an apple to apple comparison.\nNote that this idea of comparing the loading speeds of internal and external HDDs is not novel. There are already many videos and blogs on this topic - be it for computers or consoles. What\u0026rsquo;s new in this blog is to evaluate this in a [cough] scientific way - using hypothesis testing. Let\u0026rsquo;s get into a [somewhat] scientific evaluation!\nHypothesis testing on game loading task Game loading time is measured (in mm:ss) as the time taken to launch the game - from clicking on the game till the point where the player gets the control of the playable character, as shown in this video. I recorded the loading time for 10 AAA title games, with the exception of Forza Motorsport 7, where I recorded till the point where the main menu appears. Launching a race involves lot of manual selection process, which could add more variability in recording time.\nThe null hypothesis is $H_0:$ \u0026ldquo;game loading time of internal HDD is same as that of external HDD\u0026rdquo;, and the alternate hypothesis is $H_a:$ \u0026ldquo;game loading time of internal HDD is not same as that of external HDD\u0026rdquo;.\nExperimental observations The game loading times are reported in the table below.   Game Title Internal HDD Time (mm:ss) External HDD Time (mm:ss)   Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Creed Origins 01:48.50 01:51.05   Tomb Raider 00:50.95 00:41.78   Rise of Tomb Raider 02:32.14 02:15.54   Shadow of Tomb Raider 01:36.63 01:24.30   Halo Master Chief Collection 00:57.29 00:46.89   Batman: Arkham Assylum 01:09.88 01:03.00   Batman: Arkham City 01:13.94 01:12.30   Batman: Arkham Knight 01:39.64 01:36.14   Forza Horizon 4 02:33.74 02:04.31   Forza Motorsport 7 01:00.00 00:50.69  \nSince there is a one-to-one correspondence of each game, we can use paired sample T-test. We can calculate the $t$-value for the paired sample T-test using a simple formula:\n$t-value = \\frac{D_1 / N}{\\sqrt{\\frac{D_2 - D_1^2 / N}{N(N-1)}}}$\nWhere $N$ is the total number of games ($N = 10$), $D_1$ is the total difference between loading times of internal and external HDDs ($D_1 = 96.71$) and $D_2$ is the total squared difference between loading times of internal and external HDDs ($D_2 = 1641.4153$). The calculated $t$-value comes out to be 3.4526 which is greater than the threshold $t$-value of 3.250 for a significance threshold of 0.005. Hence we can reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ with 99.5% confidence and conclude that [my] external HDD is faster than the internal HDD of [my] Xbox One X.\nDisclaimer on the validity of results The above results are for a single loading of each game, and the loading time might vary by a few seconds across multiple runs. Ideally, average loading time should be used for such experiments. However, it should be noted that if the same game is loaded multiple times, the consequent loading will be faster due to memory caching. To avoid caching, games should be loaded in an alternative fashion.

R\u0026#x00E8;nyi differential privacy (RDP) is one mechanism that provides tighter composition which is widely used because of its implementation in TensorFlow Privacy (recently, Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) has shown a tighter analysis for low privacy budgets, but it was not yet available when we did this work). But the central question that remains to be answered is: how private are these methods in practice?\nIn this blog post, we answer this question by empirically evaluating the privacy leakage of differential private neural networks via membership inference attacks. This work appeared in USENIX Security\u0026rsquo;19 (full paper: PDF, talk video).\nTraining Differentially Private Models We train two-layer neural network models using a training procedure similar to the popular DPSGD procedure. The training and test sets consist of seperate 10,000 instances randomly sampled from the CIFAR-100 data set.\nThe figure below shows the accuracy loss of private models trained with na\u0026#x00EF;ve composition (NC) and R\u0026#x00E8;nyi differential privacy (RDP) with respect to a non-private model. As expected, models trained with RDP achieve much better utility when compared to the models trained with NC. To give a comparison, models trained with RDP achieve 53% accuracy loss at \\(\\epsilon = 10\\), whereas the models trained with NC achieve the same utility at \\(\\epsilon = 500\\). Due to the tighter composition, RDP mechanism adds much lesser noise when compared to NC mechanism for the same privacy budget.\nThis is great, but what about the privacy leakage?   Privacy comes at a cost To estimate privacy leakage, we implement the membership inference attack of Yeom et al and use their membership advantage metric, which is given as the difference between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of detecting whether a given instance is a part of the training set. This metric lies between 0 and 1, where 0 signifies no privacy leakage.\nAs the figure below depicts, there is a clear trade-off between privacy and utility. While the RDP mechanism achieves higher utility, it also suffers from higher privacy leakage. The attack achieves around 0.40 membership advantage score against model trained with RDP at \\(\\epsilon = 1000\\), with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 74%. While this is less than the privacy leakage of non-private model (highlighted in the figure below), it is a significant amount of leakage. On the other hand, the model has almost no utility at lower privacy budgets where the privacy leakage is low.   A more interesting observation is that we only have tight theoretical worst case guarantees on membership advantage for \\(\\epsilon \u0026lt; 1\\), at which point the models neither have any utility nor have any empirical privacy leakage. While the attacks only give a lower bound on the privacy leakage, the huge gap between the theoretical upper bound and the empirical lower bound suggests that there could be stronger attacks in practice.\nLeakage is not random We have shown above that the membership inference attack can be effective against a model trained with RDP at \\(\\epsilon = 1000\\). The members identified by the attacker are not due to the randomness in machine learning process. To show this, we run run the above experiment multiple times and note the fraction of members that are repeatedly identified across different runs. The figure below shows the results. The attacker is able to identify almost a quarter of the training records with more than 82% PPV across five runs. If the leakage was due to the randomness, we would have expected a trend similar to the dotted line.   Conclusion The differential privacy research community has come a long way to realize practical mechanisms for privacy-preserving deep learning. However, as shown in our work, we still require significant improvements to achieve meaningful utility for privacy budgets where we have strong theoretical guarantees. Concurrently, the huge gap between the empirical privacy leakage and the theoretical bounds opens the possibility for more powerful inference attacks in practice.\nAdditional Results in the Paper While we only discussed selected results in this blog post, the full paper has more experimental results across different settings as listed below:\n Results on Purchase-100 data set, derived from Kaggle website.\n Results for logistic regression model.\n Membership inference attack of Shokri et al..\n Attribute inference attack of Yeom et al.\n  ","date":1562544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563062400,"objectID":"d4f65315eedde1125cbb93ee246943cd","permalink":"https://bargavjayaraman.github.io/post/evaluating-dpml-results/","publishdate":"2019-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/evaluating-dpml-results/","section":"post","summary":"What seems safe, might not be safe in practice.","tags":["Machine Learning","Differential Privacy"],"title":"Evaluating Differentially Private Machine Learning in Practice","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

While differential privacy provides a solution to this problem, there is always a privacy-utility trade-off when training models privately, which is not well understood. Often the practical deployments choose the model utility over privacy, that may lead to indiscernable privacy vulnerabilities. One such example of privacy vulnerability is whether an adversary can identify a particular individual in the training data. Also, what type of individuals are more vulnerable to such attacks? This question is also directly related to the problem of fairness. In light of such vulnerabilities, what privacy parameters should the ML deployments use to mitigate the risks?
